Question 4:
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers
from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number

Question 5:
Define a class which has at least two methods:
    getString: to get a string from console input
    printString: to print the string in upper case.

Also please include simple test function to test the class methods.

Question 6:
Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:

Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]

Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50. H is 30.

D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.

Question 7:
Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array.
The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i _ j.

Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,Â¡Y-1. Suppose the following inputs are given to the program: 3,5

Question 8:
Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and
prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
